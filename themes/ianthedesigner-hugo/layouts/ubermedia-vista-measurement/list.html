          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            UberMedia provides the highest quality mobile data solutions trusted by businesses to creatively solve their persistent challenges. The companyâ€™s diverse suite of products process billions of social, demographic, and location signals daily for Fortune 500 companies across retail, automotive, and entertainment to better understand and influence modern consumers with the most accurate business decision science.
          </p>
          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>
            UM can analyze and measure the effectiveness of mobile ads at driving in-store visits. The problem was difficulty in requesting, managing and visualization reports. Sharing process for reports with clients was a manual process and not productizable. The primary goal was to find a way to make requesting reports easier. The secondary goal design a automatic visualization of reports. This small ask would turn into one of UberMedia's core business offerings.
          </p>

          <h3>My Role</h3>
          <p>
            Worked as the product manager in addition to the product designer and UI developer. We discovered pain-points, managed stakeholder expectations, wireframed as well as prototyped the flows/solutions, designed the visual brand, led the team, and developed the UI. Three hats are a lot of hats.

            <p>
              Technical complexity required user flows diagrams. I developed them to get technical buy-in from engineers, stakeholders, and technical advisors before design and engineering began.

            <p>
              This is part of the "campaign setup" user flow diagrams. I do these so that the engineering team, technical advisors, and stakeholders understood the technical flow.
