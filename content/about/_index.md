I am an interdisciplinary designer with +10 years of designing digital products that call the web their home. My professional experience has covered all stages of product design - including research, strategy, design, development & delivery.

### Product Designer
I‚Äôm a Product Designer who grew up on the web. I‚Äôm not a web designer as much as I think of myself as a Designer who builds products that live on the web. Most recently, I‚Äôve been a Product lead at Dave and unicorn Designer UberMedia. I enjoy solving complex problems with research and elegant UX designs.

### Front-End Developer
The question that creeps its head up way too often is, "should designers also code?" And the discussion around this has been beaten to death. I love talking about CSS, CSS frameworks, HTML templating, and web-optimization more than reliving my past travels. SASS is awesome, ReactJS is dope (though I do have some qualms with inline styling) and I get excited developing my CSS frameworks for projects.

### Photographer
I'm not like a lot of other designers who take photos. I ONLY take photos of dogs. No food, no architecture, no travel photography, no portrait work... well dog portraits, but that's the only kind of portrait I'll take. üêï
