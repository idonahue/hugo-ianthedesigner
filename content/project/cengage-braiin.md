### Problem:

Students, in higher education and professional institutions, purchase the textbooks, digital learning solutions (homework, courses, etc.), and other materials indicated by their instructors, plus additional relevant resources. Your design objective is to advance this purpose.

### Process:

I thought through how the “CengageBrain My Cart” screen should have been and not what it was. Ignore what this screen looks now. This exercise was a suggestion of what would be good design, in terms of how to achieve the site’s purpose, meet user needs, taskflow, interaction design and visual design.

**Key Findings and Problem Areas:**The My Cart has a disconnect between itself and the rest of the site and doesn’t “feel” like a standard eCommerce shopping cart.

- Page seems cluttered compared to much of the other site, this is due to layout not necessarily visual design
- Page does not have a strong upsell feature and its current version does not follow modern eCommerce norms
- Can not input promotional codes in the shopping cart
- Common “Total” feature not enables, does not include promotional discounts, shipping, and taxes
- Savings are obvious enough to help drive conversion
- Many students have to return books because they purchased the wrong edition, Calling out the “Edition” of the book could help alleviate some headache

**Areas of Focus:**

After defining my key findings and problem areas I focusing on polishing existing elements and adding features that have become standard eCommerce norms and best practices.

- Redesign “My Cart” while leveraging the strength of the current “Look & Feel”
- Redesign layout to help control visual flow and the shopping process
- Include modern upsell features for related products and other products that may relate to the products in the shopping cart
- Elevate the Promotional Code feature to help drive conversion
- Integrate the “Total” feature in the shopping cart
- Point out savings throughout the cart
- Incorporate the “Edition” of each book so customers clearly know which Edition they are purchasing

The goal of this design was to be “clean and simple” and provide clarity to the information provided. eCommerce has a become standardized and that standardization allows for quicker check outs and higher conversions. Marketing of additional products can raise the average Cart value and increase conversion. Combining these two factors in the standard practice is ideal for quick and easy check out.

**Features**

- Uses standard/common eCommerce purchasing process flow
- Very “Clean” and “Simple” layout and design
- Quickly and easily implementation

### Concept 2

**Design Intentions:**The goal of this design was to be “clean and simple” and provide clarity to the information provided. eCommerce has a become standardized and that standardization allows for quicker check outs and higher conversions. Marketing of additional products can raise the average Cart value and increase conversion. Combining these two factors in the standard practice is ideal for quick and easy check out.
