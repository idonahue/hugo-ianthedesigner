## German Resources (Tools)

### Dictionaries

**[dict.cc](https://dict.cc)**

Robust and complete online dictionary. It is open-source and community maintained. It will have the MOST possible translations but not as curated as professionally published dictionary.

**Pons**

Pons is a dictionary company with an online tool. I recommend it but it doesn't have quite as many enteries for some words. It also has a nice and clean UI compared to dict.cc's mobile app. Additionally, when you are in your A levels still getting used reading, Pons has words broken down into syllables which was useful for me. [Mitbewohner(in) > Mit ‚Ä¢ be ‚Ä¢ woh ‚Ä¢ ner(in)]

**Deepl.com**

Forget Google Translate. DeepL is your a much better translation when you need to translate large blocks of text. I use DeepL when I don't quite understand a sentence due to grammar, to many commas, or a colloquial phrase that doesn't make sense when I look up the individual words in a dictionary.

[**Verbix](https://www.verbix.com/languages/german.html)** (Verb Conjugator)

Perfect for those times when you don't know if its a regular or irregular verb and how to conjugate past tense.

## Books

### Instruction Books

These are the books I used in my Intensive German program (Kapitel Zwei).

A1.1 & A1.2 -

A2.1 & A2.2 -

B1.1 & B1.2 -

B2.1 & B2.2 - Sicher! (Publisher Hueber)

### Exercise Books

**Grammatik Series** (A-Grammatik, B-Grammatic, etc.)

A-Grammatik (A level) has English and German text for helping. The exercises are good for learning A. I highly recommend this book for learning grammar rules.  It's around ‚Ç¨20 but I think well worth it. You can do it in pencil and do exercises multiple times if you want more repetition.

B-Grammatik is entirely in German.

## Schools

**Berlin**

Kapitel Zwei (Intensive Course (12 hours a week), ‚Ç¨222 a month.

## Audio & Video

Video

[**Extra**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPUCTP_SQ9Q&list=PLGQBKSq2HITf3Px13eDGBgmJEeXfWa3wC) (Sa, Sasha und Anna)

Designed to learn German. This is older than others but the most fun compared to other shows.

**Nico Weg**

Designed to learn German. Made by [DW.com](http://dw.com) and has a quality production value and shorter episodes. That being said, the situations are not as enjoyable as "Extra." Worth watching üëç

## Tools (Learning Tools)

### Apps

**Learning Apps**

**Chatterbug** [Free & Subscription based)

This is my favorite Learning App. It has a self-studying program that I have used for +15 hours on my own and I really like it. It teach grammar in english, has flashcard exercises, writing exercises and video/audio exercises.

**Duolingo** [Free]

Duolingo is not great for learning a language but great for learning numbers, vocabulary and getting much needed repetition for learning vocabulary. Duolingo is free so you have nothing to lose. Also, if you don't know how or why you did something wrong, you can ask for help, but most likely, an answer to your quest already exist with a clear answer.

**Babbel**

I have not used Babbel but I have read good reviews. It is not free but almost always has a special offer, dont pay full price!

**Exercise Apps**

[**Quizlet**](https://quizlet.com/)

Flashcard App (Web, iOS, Android)

Easier to use than Anki but not opensource. It is much more robust and should be thought of as a web application. You can also use them on your mobile device.  

**Anki**

Flashcard app that is Opensoruce (Windows, Mac, Web, iOS, Android).

This is an old app but if you like opensource, this is for you. It can import Excel documents. Cards can NOT be shared as easily as Quizlet.
