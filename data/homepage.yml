  content : "I'm an interdisciplinary Product Designer and former startup cofounder. I’m currently a Freelance Product Design Lead designing workspace tools at Dave and UberMedia. I focus on making complex workflows simple, effective, and delightful. Also, I build front-ends. My core skills are empathy, problem-solving, and execution. I'm blessed to have built my own company, been acquired, and learned a lot along the way. But I’ll never stop learning. Reach out if you’re interested in working together."
